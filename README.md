An anonymous blog that cannot be censored

__Benefits__
>Secure, cheap, efficient, anonymous, and most important one is uncensorable!

__Implementation__
>After realizing, this big problem just started to think about what could be done to solve this and what the users going to need it. After planning I went to coding directly on https://beta.solpg.io/.

__Why Solana__
