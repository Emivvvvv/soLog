# soLog
Blog smart contract on Solana blockchain written in Rust Anchor framework

Title: soLog
Overview: An anonymous blog that cannot be censored

Problem: Web2 contents are easy to block by governments.
Solution: I made a blog that will be on the blockchain so NO ONE can censor NO ONE's blog and comment.
Features: Create your profile and start posting your long or normal post. Comment text, gifs, and images to others' posts!
Benefits: Secure, cheap, efficient, anonymous, and most important one is uncensorable!
Implementation: After realizing, this big problem just started to think about what could be done to solve this and what the users going to need it. After planning I went to coding directly on https://beta.solpg.io/.
Why Solana: Fast, cheap, scalable, and easy to write smart contracts.
Conclusion: I believe that we are losing our freedom day by day. With this blog app, people can easily taste freedom and prevent censorship!
